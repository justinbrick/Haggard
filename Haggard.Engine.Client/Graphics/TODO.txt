Planned implementation:
Right now, focus is on getting a working rendering system implementation.
If done correctly, rendering should be system-based, meaning that models and whatever else don't really matter -
those are implementation specific. But, it is desired in the future that the interfaces for rendering are all
alike, so that people can contribute new rendering engines in the future.

For reference, Unreal Engine's RHI implementation should be considered a baseline, but without any of the
tech debt that they introduce via C++ and other bad implementations that they have.

Side note: WebGPU provides a decent interface as well, both of these might be usable as inspiration,
but both require modification to work for this use case.
